HTTP_CODE_CHEATSHEET | Ver. 0.1.0

A simple react web app where a users can type an http return code to learn it's 
meaning. Little better than a google search, but done for practice and to 
learn more about linking react frontends to node/express backends. 


NOTE: 
I was unable to upload the backend files to the repo, though the gross majority
are express and nodemon dependencies. I will likely add the 'serever.js' file 
seperately to preserve the api data.
